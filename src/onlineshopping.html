                            Founded in 1996 by Jeff Bezos, Amazon capitalized on the fact that many people just simply do not want to leave their house when shopping
                            for goods, or in some cases, cannot find an item they need in the stores around them. For a while Amazon seemed to be one of the only
                            sites where online shopping of this sort was possible. Then, in the early thousands, eBay came along and snagged the spot of being the No.1 online
                            shopping website (peaking at No.4).

                            Come 2010 it can be seen that Amazon broke into the Top 5 most visited websites. No longer was eBay the most prevalent. Although, eBay still had a
                            niche. However, when looking at the numbers, there is no denying that Amazon was more successful than any other wanna-be competitor. Sure, Amazon
                            may not be in the top 10 most visited websites currently, but does that really matter when you are Jeff Bezos? Of course not. Bezos made his fortune off
                            of Amazon's success, and while he may not be the most respectable man in the world, he is definitely one of the brightest men out there when it comes to money.

                            It is reported that by 2026 Bezos might actually become the worlds first trillionaire.
                            That is $1,000,000,000,000. A feat that no one else has accomplished.
