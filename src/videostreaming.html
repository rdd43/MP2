                            What would be entertainment online if not for video streaming services?
                            A website like Youtube was way ahead of its time during its inception in 2005.
                            A website that broke into the top ten most visited websites only a year after it was created.
                            Currently Youtube is holding the No.2 spot, after competing and trading the spot with Facebook for several years.

                            Of course, Youtube is not the only video streaming service that exists. I'm sure that many people do not even think of
                            Youtube when they think of video streaming. Many people default to Netflix, or even Hulu before thinking of Youtube.
                            The truth of it is that Youtube most likely was the inspiration for Netflix streaming, as it was not until 2007 when Netflix
                            introduced these services in the first place.

                            Not all streaming comes from prerecorded footage and movies. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.tv</a> is a live streaming platform
                            where anyone can perform live for an audience. Most <u>streamers</u> on this platform defer to playing video games. Over time they acquire a
                            massive audience that primarily will go to Twitch for their entertainment needs.

                            Youtube was the pioneer for a market that was mostly undiscovered. The success of the website cannot be understated.
                            Twitch can be considered the website that achieved similar success in the live streaming area of media.
                            Of course, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and many other streaming services exist, however none truly hold a candle to the empire that is Youtube.

                            than on traditional methods. Movie theaters and traditional television are losing viewers everyday.
