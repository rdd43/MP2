                            Originally known as America Online, AOL is a web portal and online service provider (not to be confused with internet service
                            provider) based in NYC. In 1995 AOL grew to become the one of the larger online service provider, and at the start of
                            our timeline in 1996 we find them at the No. 1 spot.

                            One of the early pioneers of the internet. In the mid 90's AOL was recognized by pretty much every user on the internet. They provided a dial-up service
                            to millions of Americans, and combined with that service they would package their web portal, e-mail, instant messaging, and later on their own web browser.

                            AOL being the most popular website in the mid to late 90's makes sense. During this time there was basically no one competing against them.
                            It was a product of the time. If you wanted to do almost anything you would go to AOL.
