                            With the internet and websites becoming such a popular medium, there is no denying that there was an effect on
                            how businesses run and operate. Some businesses have their entire model structured around working with the internet and
                            having a great website. Just look at Google, Facebook, Amazon. If it was not for their website then these three titans of
                            the corporate world would not exist.

                            Many other companies tried to emulate the success found by other pioneers, utilizing the internet and
                            capitalizing on the market space that was there. It just so happened that Microsoft is not only one of these pioneers, but
                            also a company that capitalized on the space that they found.

                            Many businesses use Microsoft related products in their day to day workflow. Microsoft office, outlook, word, and who can forget excel?
                            Microsoft not only took advantage of the market that they found, but they also revolutionised the business world with the products and
                            services that they delivered.
