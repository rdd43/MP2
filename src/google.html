                            What would be a website about the most influential websites if it did not include Google?
                            Virtually inescapable, Google has become the Disney of the internet. But, it was not always like this.
                            There was a time when Google was simply an idea in the heads of Larry Page and Sergey Brin.

                            If you were to Google what Google's mission statement is you would find it to be "to
                            organize the worldâ€™s information and make it universally accessible and useful."
                            In today's age, this is easy to see first hand. Simply go to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google.com</a>
                            and just type in "Google's mission statement." This may
                            seem a bit redundant, right? Well, not really. If you think about it, Google has
                            accomplished something that changed the world forever. The ability to look up anything at any time and get an answer that
                            is (almost always) correct.
                        </p>

                            Google has not only (for the most part) come extremely close to achieving their goals, but have also kickstarted more projects
                            than most other companies of their size. It is no wonder that when people think of the "Big Five" they think of Google at the top.
                            Currently, Google resides as the No.1 Most visited website.

                        <p>
                            Before the 90s Search Engines were simply an idea. As a user of the internet, either you knew
                            enough sites to get around, or you just have to
                            fine out the old fashioned way, through books, forums or just word of mouth.</p>
                        <p>
                            Google changed the way that people think of search engines. No longer do people need to wonder of
                            how to find a piece of information or go searching in books for most information. All thanks to Google.
