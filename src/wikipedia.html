                            Have you ever Googled something? Do not answer, everyone knows that you have, I have, and almost everyone
                            else who has access to the internet has as well. Let's say you Googled "Who was Abraham Lincoln." You will
                            find some pictures of the past president, a little paragraph answering the question. If you look a little
                            to the right you will see "Abraham Lincoln. 16th U.S. President" as well as a picture of the man himself.
                            Then you see a small tad of the information that can be found on Wikipedia, including birthday, height,
                            and the day he was assassinated.

                            Google does have the power to find you information seamlessly. But, I believe that a lot of people take for
                            granted that Wikipedia, for the most part, is the site that allows Google to have this power. Wikipedia will
                            have an answer for almost anything that anyone will Google. On top of this, the service is entirely ran by
                            people like you and I. The average everyday person. This, of course, does come with several concerns.

                            How can you be sure that the answer that Google gives you is correct, if Wikipedia is a site that Google
                            draws many of its answers from? Well to post something or eddit someone else's entry on Wikipedia is relatively easy.
                            This means that misinformation is easy to spread. The thing is, if you are a savvy internet user, you will know that
                            many Wikipedia articles do have sources and credibility to them. Through these sources you can find even more answers
                            about the topic that you are searching for. Having access to almost any answer to any piece of information at any time
                            is a super power that not everyone realises they have. That super power is thanks to Wikipedia.
