                            Yahoo was an early pioneer on the internet, finding millions upon million of users in only two years after it was created by
                            Jerry Yang and David Filo. Although having major success and being a top 3 website for years, it was not until mid 2001 when
                            Yahoo solidified itself at the No.1 spot of most websites visited on the internet.

                            Yahoo was also the first website to ever break a billion clicks in around Jun of 2001. Of course, this was still relatively early in
                            the time frame that I am concerning myself with. However, even more impressively was that Yahoo managed to hold onto this spot for a little
                            over five years. Of course, the website that took this spot was none other than Google.

                            The peak of Yahoo's online traffic was around 6,530,000,000. An impressive feat. This is not saying over six billion users, simply that the website
                            generated enough traffic in a set span of time that is equal to about six and a half billion monthly visits. Compare this to today's number one spot Google
                            and the number isn't even a tenth of what Google pulls in.

                            In 2017 the internet service provider Verizon actually purchased Yahoo for $4.5 billion dollars.
                            Having seen that the revenue for Yahoo was shrinking ever since the website peaked between 2006-2007, was this purchase a poor decision?
                            The last 10-k that is public currently is from 2016, when the company had around $5 billion in revenue for the year. At the time, it seemed like a sinking ship.
