                            Many of Facebook's features were not unique to Facebook itself when the platform first launched in 2004.
                            Initially Facebook was simply just an improved Myspace (another social networking site that was more popular at the time).
                            However, what initially set Facebook apart was the fact that it was limited to Harvard Students, and later extended to other Ivy League universities.

                            Myspace dominated the social networking space until around 2008 when Facebook not only overtook the website as the primarily social networking website,
                            but also taking making its way into the top three spot kicking the previous No.3 most visited webiste at the time, AOL.
                            This then begs the question of what happened in the time between Facebook's first launch in 2004 and its rise in 2008? What changed about the website?

                            Notably, Facebook is a website that is extremely user friendly. It makes it incredibly easy to connect with others around you. Combine this with
                            friends that are easy to find, an instant messaging system that felt good to use, and maybe different features like a News Feed, Liking Posts, and a Timeline,
                            you now have a recipe for the best social networking platform available. This was not a case of "no competition." Facebook WAS the competition during its rise.

                            Through the years it can be seen that Facebook has truly aligned itself with Disney's way of thinking.
                            They have purchased the following entities that tried to move into the social networking space:
                            Instagram, WhatsApp, and FriendFeed just to name a few. They even tried to buy Snapchat, but when Mark Zuckerberg
                            (the creator of Facebook) was declined, he instead turned his sights to killing Snapchat through Instagram.
