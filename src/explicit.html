                            Of course, if the ability is there, the internet will find a way to sexualize it. And, of course, if there is
                            a website dedicated to 18+ videos and sexualization there will also be tons of internet traffic.
                            At the end of the timeline in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Uj1A9AguFs&app=desktop">video</a> you can
                            find not one, but TWO websites that sneaked their way into the top ten list.
                            Xvideos coming in at No.8, and right from the back of that you can see Pornhub at No.10.

                            These websites are definitely not the only websites that are finding success in this market.
                            They are, however, the websites that people are directed when they search for explicit content.
                            The interesting thing to note is that while these websites may be so dominant, magazine publishers like
                            Playboy still were producing and raking in tons of money.

                            Content of this nature can be traced all the back to ancient times. However, traditional publication and
                            popularization of this kind of subject matter really started to pick up in the 1950s when Hugh Hefner started the
                            Playboy Magazine.
