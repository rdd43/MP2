                            Websites are important. They are the driving force behind many major projects that would have been
                            impossible if it was not for the internet. I think it is important for everyone to take a look at their own ideas,
                            their own goals, and see if they can focus on trying to make these goals and ideas reality. For so many people out there
                            it all starts with a single website. It could be for you too.
