                                <p>Many of Facebook's features were not unique to Facebook itself when the
                                    platform first launched in 2004. Initially Facebook was simply just an
                                    improved Myspace (another social networking site that was more popular
                                    at the time). However, what initially set Facebook apart was the fact that
                                    it was limited to Harvard Students, and later extended to other Ivy League
                                    universities.</p>
                                <p>Myspace dominated the social networking space until around 2008 when Facebook
                                    not only overtook the website as the primarily social networking website,
                                    but also taking making its way into the top three spot kicking the previous
                                    No.3 most visited webiste at the time, AOL. This then begs the question
                                    of what happened in the time between Facebook's first launch in 2004 and
                                    its rise in 2008? What changed about the website?</p>
                                <p>Notably, Facebook is a website that is extremely user friendly. It makes
                                    it incredibly easy to connect with others around you. Combine this with
                                    friends that are easy to find, an instant messaging system that felt good
                                    to use, and maybe different features like a News Feed, Liking Posts, and
                                    a Timeline, you now have a recipe for the best social networking platform
                                    available. This was not a case of "no competition." Facebook WAS the competition
                                    during its rise.</p>

                                    with Disney's way of thinking. They have purchased the following entities
                                    that tried to move into the social networking space: Instagram, WhatsApp,
                                    and FriendFeed just to name a few. They even tried to buy Snapchat, but
                                    when Mark Zuckerberg (the creator of Facebook) was declined, he instead
                                    turned his sights to killing Snapchat through Instagram.</p>
